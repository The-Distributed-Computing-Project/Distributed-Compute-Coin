# Distributed Computing Blockchain Cryptocurrency
A unique blockchain built in C#, with a client for trading, a host for distribution, and a miner for mining. This crypto can be bought, traded, sold, or used just like any other. What sets it apart though is how it can be used. I am implementing a system into it just like the Folding@home project with distributed computing power. Anybody will be able to submit code to be computed or hosted across the peer-to-peer network, and will pay for that using this crypto.
### Client
The client has multiple uses. It can be used to view your current funds, trade crypto with other people, and submit code or computational tasks for the peer-to-peer distributed computing power network.
### Miner
The miner allows you to mine any pending blocks received from the server, then after mining a block to get a reward. Currently I am planning for the computational tasks to be divided by the miners only, because they are more reliable and more powerful.
