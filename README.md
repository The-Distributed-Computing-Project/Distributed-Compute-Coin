# Cryptocurrency
A blockchain built in C#, with a client for trading, a host for distribution, and a miner for mining.
## Project
My goal with this project is to create a new cryptocurrency, with the same idea as the protein folding project at home. This crypto can be bought, traded, sold, or used.
