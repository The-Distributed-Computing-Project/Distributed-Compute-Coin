# Distributed Computing Blockchain Cryptocurrency
A unique blockchain built in C#, with a client for trading, a host for distribution, and a miner for mining. This crypto can be bought, traded, sold, or used just like any other. What sets it apart though is how it can be used. I am implementing a system into it just like the Folding@home project with distributed computing power. Anybody will be able to submit code to be computed or hosted across the peer-to-peer network, and will pay for that using this crypto.
### Client
The client has multiple uses. It can be used to view your current funds, trade crypto with other people, and submit code or computational tasks for the peer-to-peer distributed computing network.
### Miner
The miner allows you to mine any pending blocks received from the server, then after mining a block to get a reward. Currently I am planning for the computational tasks to be divided among the miners only, because they are more reliable and more powerful.
* One block should be mined on average every 5 seconds

### Tasks
Currently I am trying to figure out how I should implement the distributed computing network, so it is more accessible for people to create <i>(So they won't need to program a full client and host and/or make changes to allow for my code)</i>, and so it is not abused to spread malware/trojans. One important thing that I don't want to happen is extended mining power, because if you simply upload a mining application and hard-code your credentials, you could create a free money machine or fully collapse the crypto with everyone using everyone elses mining power.
